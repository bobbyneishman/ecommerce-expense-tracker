# Simple Expense Tracker for Online Ecommerce Businesses

A basic web application designed specifically for online Ecommerce store owners to manually track their business expenses simply and effectively.

## Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Scope

The initial goal is to create the most basic, usable tool focused solely on manual expense entry and viewing for Ecommerce businesses.

### Core MVP Features:

*   **Manual Expense Entry Form:** Allows users to input:
    *   Date
    *   Expense Amount
    *   Vendor/Description (e.g., "Facebook Ads", "Shopify Fee")
    *   Category (selected from a predefined list)
*   **Basic Ecommerce Categories:** Pre-defined, relevant categories:
    *   Advertising & Marketing
    *   Platform Fees (Shopify, Etsy, Amazon, etc.)
    *   Shipping & Fulfillment Costs
    *   Software & Tools
    *   Cost of Goods Sold (Optional for V1 - might simplify further)
    *   Other/Miscellaneous
*   **View Expenses List:** A simple table or list displaying recorded expenses, sortable by date.
*   **Basic Summary:** Shows the total expenses for a selected period (e.g., current month).

### Features NOT Included in MVP:

*   Income tracking
*   Automatic bank/platform connections (Manual entry ONLY)
*   Complex reporting or charts
*   Invoice tracking
*   Tax calculations
*   Inventory features
*   User accounts (potentiallydeferring for absolute simplest start)
*   Mobile App (Web-based only)

## The Ecommerce "Twist"

This tool differentiates itself from generic trackers by:

*   Providing relevant Ecommerce expense categories **out-of-the-box**.
*   Using terminology familiar to online sellers.
*   Focusing on simplicity over excessive features.
